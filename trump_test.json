It is so unfair with such bad, Fake News! Why wouldn‚Äôt they act. When the World watches @CNN, it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!"},{"text":"Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative &amp; so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesn‚Äôt owner @ATT do something?"},{"text":"China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking Billions!"},{"text":"Thank you! üá∫üá∏üá¨üáß https://t.co/hm6RXLeWpp"},{"text":"....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom, and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!"},{"text":".@SadiqKhan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly ‚Äúnasty‚Äù to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me......"},{"text":"BIG NEWS! As I promised two weeks ago, the first shipment of LNG has just left the Cameron LNG Export Facility in Louisiana. Not only have thousands of JOBS been created in USA, we‚Äôre shipping freedom and opportunity abroad!"},{"text":"Kevin Hassett, who has done such a great job for me and the Administration, will be leaving shortly. His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S. I want to thank Kevin for all he has done - he is a true friend!"},{"text":"Hearing word that Russia, Syria and, to a lesser extent, Iran, are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria, and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose, what will it get you? STOP!"},{"text":"Democrats can‚Äôt impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats.
